## What does this project do?

This program is meant to transform a PDF file that contains a university syllabus, and puts the important dates into your google calendar.

## How do we make this project work?
This project utilizes multiple API's to assist in development. These API's are Google Calendar, and it translates the PDF file to json, which is then read by the program to put the dates in the Google calendar

## Program Constraints
